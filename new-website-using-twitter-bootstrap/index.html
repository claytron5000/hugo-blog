<p>I’ve also been working with the twitter bootstrap framework. It’s simple a set of CSS and Javascript libraries that make laying out and building responsive websites very easy. It includes a whole slew of pre-built classes to do this from formatting: “.col-md-6” to assets “.btn-navbar” and more. The final layout is slightly different, but follows the spirit and feel of the original design. Because it’s basically a flat brochure site with very little content it only took a day + to complete.</p>

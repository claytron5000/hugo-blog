<div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>At the beginning of this year Chrome came out with Local Overrides features for <a href=https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/devtools>Chrome 65</a>. This is related, but distinct from <a href=https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/workspaces/>Workspaces</a>, which is a way to save your devtools changes to a local project. While Workspaces seems neat, it&rsquo;s rare that I&rsquo;m working on a site whose code isn&rsquo;t generated by some server-side tool.

<p>I knew this would be useful when I saw it, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure how. Then, I was presented with a problem with the External Links Drupal module. This module provides external link icons to links that lead off the current domain. It also provides ways of excluding, including and regex-ing links to decide if you want it to have the external icon or not. We had implemented a configuration fix for a site using the module. However, on our testing site, the external icon no longer showed up. I suspected this was a result of the difference in the urls. The hard part was when it turned out that the logic that controlled internal/external links was constructed entirely in client-side JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of the External Links module is in no way endorsed by the writer of this post&mldr;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the situation was this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A live site implements this feature that works as expected.</li>
<li>A test site with a different url structure worked differently.</li>
<li>The logic governing these two situations runs entirely on page load.</li>
<li>The logic comprised of a five line <code>if..else</code> statement.</li>
<li>I want to compare the logic of the two sites.</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex=0><code>if (url.indexOf('http') === 0
        &amp;&amp; ((!url.match(internal_link) &amp;&amp; !(extExclude &amp;&amp; url.match(extExclude))) || (extInclude &amp;&amp; url.match(extInclude)))
        &amp;&amp; !(extCssExclude &amp;&amp; $(this).is(extCssExclude))
        &amp;&amp; !(extCssExclude &amp;&amp; $(this).parents(extCssExclude).length &gt; 0)
        &amp;&amp; !(extCssExplicit &amp;&amp; $(this).parents(extCssExplicit).length &lt; 1)) {
        external_links.push(this);
      }
</code></pre><p>Since I can&rsquo;t start <code>console.log</code>ing on the live site, this was the perfect place to try out Local Overrides!</p>

<p>This is pretty cool. It gave me the tools I needed to compare complicated multi-line switch statements on two sites, without modifying production code, or any server code.</p>
<p>The danger, which you might be anticipating, is that it&rsquo;s easy to forget that this is turned on, and load the page with unexpected behavior. That said, this could also be leveraged to add personalized behavior to certain sites.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a pretty cool tool and one I&rsquo;m sure to use in the future.</p>

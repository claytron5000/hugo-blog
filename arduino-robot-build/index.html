<h1 class=title>Arduino robot build</h1>
<div class=content>
<p>I’m a perennial tinkerer, and as such have always been fascinated by Arduino. When I first started using computers I wanted to trigger events in the real world, that wasn’t realized until I purchased an Arduino clone from Sparkfun.</p>
<p>After blinking the led I struggled to find a real-world use for the thing. After a short-lived foray into making a washing-machine monitor, it sat for a long time gathering dust.</p>
<p>Finally my son asked me to build a robot. That’s real-world enough!</p>
<p>I ordered a set of wheels, motors and motor shield, again from Sparkfun,and set to work. Using the box the shield came in, I cut holes and used the box as the chassis. This created problems later on, but was a cheap way to build the robot.</p>
<p>I had previously purchased and accelerometer for the aborted washing-machine project, so that would be my blind robot’s way of finding it’s place in the world.</p>
<p>I wanted low-profile style wheels, so my cutaways were designed so the motors sat inside the box. This was a challenge since the weight of the entire robot would be pulling down, away from the motors. My first solution was to hot-glue the motors in place.</p>
<p>I soldered the jumpers, then hot-glued the motors in a flip-flop pattern, only to realize I hadn’t tested the motors, oops. I tested each motor with a 9v battery only to discover neither ran. I know my soldering skills are sub-par, but that was terrible. I kicked myself for not testing before glueing.</p>
<p>Disheartened, I put the project aside for a couple months.</p>
<p>When I came back to it, I decided to throw caution into the wind and just ripped the motors out. After that I realized my battery was dead, and the soldering was fine. :face-palm:</p>
<p>Somewhere in phase 2 I ran out of hot glue, and didn’t want to spend anymore money. After floundering I found a roll of double-sided tape for those window plastic wraps. That stuff is the best and is sure to be used in my next project.</p>
<p>Having finally resolved the battery issue and fixing the motors in place, I was finally able to write some code. I cribbed Shield control code from <a href=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ardumoto-shield-hookup-guide/example-code>Sparkfun</a>. With this code I could pre-program some “dumb” movements on the robot, but I wanted him to explore the world.</p>
<p>Next coding challenge was to connect the accelerometer and get some inputs.</p>
<p>This gives me a simple scaled measure of the change in momentum along the x axis. It might behoove me to get the changes along the z and y axis as well.</p>
<p>With some experimentation I figured that getting a reading of</p>
<p>is approximate to when it bumps into something at full speed.</p>
<p>One issue is that the accelerometer trips that value when the it accelerates, doi. To try and solve this I created a function to slowly accelerate:</p>
<p>Now I could pass some back-up and turn around behavior into an if block:</p>
<p>My bump detection is largely ad-hoc, and particular to the floor, speed of the motors, etc that will affect the trigger value.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the next step is to use all three accelerometer axises and to graph them in real-time. That way I can get better data on what is a bump-stop versus a bump in the carpet.</p>
<p>I stuck an oversized caster to the robot to help it move more smoothly, this gives it a canted-up look I don’t love. Also, the caster get’s stuck every once in a while and sends the robot in circles.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to get another input to let the robot know when to turn. I’ve noticed that when it runs into something the motors strain, and I wonder if there’s a way to get data back from the motors to let us know when it’s jammed.</p>

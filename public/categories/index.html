      I recently was assigned a CSS layout problem. As I was working on it I realized I hadn&rsquo;t done CSS for a while. I also noticed I was thinking in a slightly different manner then when I&rsquo;m writing PHP or JavaScript. I was thinking systematically about the problem, instead of thinking methodically.
The CSS layout system (I&rsquo;m talking here about last-generation pre-grid CSS layout) centers around the Box Model. What this means is an element is comprised of the content, padding, border and margins, in that order from inside out.

      At the beginning of this year Chrome came out with Local Overrides features for Chrome 65. This is related, but distinct from Workspaces, which is a way to save your devtools changes to a local project. While Workspaces seems neat, it&rsquo;s rare that I&rsquo;m working on a site whose code isn&rsquo;t generated by some server-side tool. However, with Local Overrides I can work in the devtools inspector, and still persist those changes between page loads, even if they are separate from the project.

      Last week on twitter Dan Abramov was highlighting some of the easy ways to get your feet wet with React. I&rsquo;ve been playing with React for a while, and had heard the idea that one could add React as an individual component, or widget, to an already existing site. This looked like a good opportunity to try it out.
Caveat before we begin, the docs are great, there&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m expanding here on what&rsquo;s already covered in the docs.

      I was tasked with creating a scroll animation, something that I’ve done before, but in a very ad-hoc fashion. I think the first time I did a “parallax” style scroll I did something like this:
That worked fine on an overpowered PC and when it was moving a tiny image up and off the page, but the next task was to move an image across the page in response to scrolling, and I wanted to make sure it was performant on all devices.

      I took a look at Google’s parent company Alphabet’s website today. It a clean little one-pager. The thing I noticed was their handling of the logo.

      This afternoon I was replacing a .png image with an .svg. Working in my local development environment, I started with a simple ``. It looked like a broken link. Next I went to CSS-Tricks and used the first fall-back technique he lists:

This also resulted in a broken link.
I banged my head against the wall for at least an hour, checking the path, swapping .svg for .png. Everything I could think of.

      In the face of police violence toward Black Americans I feel mostly helpless and useless. I&rsquo;m not in the path of police violence; I&rsquo;m white, employed, and comfortable, and with two kids depending on my income, it&rsquo;s easy to remain inactive and on the sidelines. While I can state clearly, Black Lives Matter, I didn&rsquo;t have an obvious means of action.
But I want to examine a little deeper how I&rsquo;m complicit in a system of white supremacy through my engagement with the React framework.

      This is a trick I figured out when a client wanted to have chevron icon to the right of a block title. However, they didn’t want the chevron to break to it’s own line, unless the title itself broke to the new line. Basically, the chevron need to act like it was part of the last word, and maintain space between itself and that word. Also, the chervon moves to the right on hover.

      I spent a solid hour this morning perfecting my keyboard shortcuts. Productivity, at this point, is really more of a feeling than something to measure. I’m sure if I actually measured the amount of time saved by Command + Tab versus using the mouse I would only be saving a few seconds every day. The point of streamlining my computer processes is not the time saved, but the feeling of streamlining.

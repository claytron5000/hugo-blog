<h1 class=title><a href=https://claytron5000.github.io/hugo-blog/methodical-versus-systematic/>Methodical versus Systematic</a></h1>
<div class=content>
I recently was assigned a CSS layout problem. As I was working on it I realized I hadn&rsquo;t done CSS for a while. I also noticed I was thinking in a slightly different manner then when I&rsquo;m writing PHP or JavaScript. I was thinking systematically about the problem, instead of thinking methodically.
The CSS layout system (I&rsquo;m talking here about last-generation pre-grid CSS layout) centers around the Box Model. What this means is an element is comprised of the content, padding, border and margins, in that order from inside out.

<div class=content>
At the beginning of this year Chrome came out with Local Overrides features for Chrome 65. This is related, but distinct from Workspaces, which is a way to save your devtools changes to a local project. While Workspaces seems neat, it&rsquo;s rare that I&rsquo;m working on a site whose code isn&rsquo;t generated by some server-side tool. However, with Local Overrides I can work in the devtools inspector, and still persist those changes between page loads, even if they are separate from the project.

<div class=content>
Last week on twitter Dan Abramov was highlighting some of the easy ways to get your feet wet with React. I&rsquo;ve been playing with React for a while, and had heard the idea that one could add React as an individual component, or widget, to an already existing site. This looked like a good opportunity to try it out.
Caveat before we begin, the docs are great, there&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m expanding here on what&rsquo;s already covered in the docs.

<div class=content>
I was tasked with creating a scroll animation, something that I’ve done before, but in a very ad-hoc fashion. I think the first time I did a “parallax” style scroll I did something like this:
That worked fine on an overpowered PC and when it was moving a tiny image up and off the page, but the next task was to move an image across the page in response to scrolling, and I wanted to make sure it was performant on all devices.

<div class=content>
I’m a perennial tinkerer, and as such have always been fascinated by Arduino. When I first started using computers I wanted to trigger events in the real world, that wasn’t realized until I purchased an Arduino clone from Sparkfun.
After blinking the led I struggled to find a real-world use for the thing. After a short-lived foray into making a washing-machine monitor, it sat for a long time gathering dust.

<div class=content>
I took a look at Google’s parent company Alphabet’s website today. It a clean little one-pager. The thing I noticed was their handling of the logo.
At first it looks like a simple logo font. Turns out their doing some old-school web shenanigans.

<div class=content>
This afternoon I was replacing a .png image with an .svg. Working in my local development environment, I started with a simple ``. It looked like a broken link. Next I went to CSS-Tricks and used the first fall-back technique he lists:
``
This also resulted in a broken link.
I banged my head against the wall for at least an hour, checking the path, swapping .svg for .png. Everything I could think of.

<div class=content>
This year I noticed that my Facebook had become high-jacked by viral-videos, Upworthy-style misleading article titles and pictures of very small houses. I have a few specific functions I want Facebook to perform for me in this order.
Keep up to date with the major and minor life changes of a broad group of associates I wouldn’t otherwise keep in touch with. I think of loose friends from college, high school friends, family friends, etc.

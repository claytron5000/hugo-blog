I recently was assigned a CSS layout problem. As I was working on it I realized I hadn&rsquo;t done CSS for a while. I also noticed I was thinking in a slightly different manner then when I&rsquo;m writing PHP or JavaScript. I was thinking systematically about the problem, instead of thinking methodically.
The CSS layout system (I&rsquo;m talking here about last-generation pre-grid CSS layout) centers around the Box Model. What this means is an element is comprised of the content, padding, border and margins, in that order from inside out.

At the beginning of this year Chrome came out with Local Overrides features for Chrome 65. This is related, but distinct from Workspaces, which is a way to save your devtools changes to a local project. While Workspaces seems neat, it&rsquo;s rare that I&rsquo;m working on a site whose code isn&rsquo;t generated by some server-side tool. However, with Local Overrides I can work in the devtools inspector, and still persist those changes between page loads, even if they are separate from the project.

Last week on twitter Dan Abramov was highlighting some of the easy ways to get your feet wet with React. I&rsquo;ve been playing with React for a while, and had heard the idea that one could add React as an individual component, or widget, to an already existing site. This looked like a good opportunity to try it out.
Caveat before we begin, the docs are great, there&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m expanding here on what&rsquo;s already covered in the docs.

I was tasked with creating a scroll animation, something that I’ve done before, but in a very ad-hoc fashion. I think the first time I did a “parallax” style scroll I did something like this:
That worked fine on an overpowered PC and when it was moving a tiny image up and off the page, but the next task was to move an image across the page in response to scrolling, and I wanted to make sure it was performant on all devices.

I’m a perennial tinkerer, and as such have always been fascinated by Arduino. When I first started using computers I wanted to trigger events in the real world, that wasn’t realized until I purchased an Arduino clone from Sparkfun.
After blinking the led I struggled to find a real-world use for the thing. After a short-lived foray into making a washing-machine monitor, it sat for a long time gathering dust.

I took a look at Google’s parent company Alphabet’s website today. It a clean little one-pager. The thing I noticed was their handling of the logo.
At first it looks like a simple logo font. Turns out their doing some old-school web shenanigans.

This afternoon I was replacing a .png image with an .svg. Working in my local development environment, I started with a simple ``. It looked like a broken link. Next I went to CSS-Tricks and used the first fall-back technique he lists:
``
This also resulted in a broken link.
I banged my head against the wall for at least an hour, checking the path, swapping .svg for .png. Everything I could think of.

This year I noticed that my Facebook had become high-jacked by viral-videos, Upworthy-style misleading article titles and pictures of very small houses. I have a few specific functions I want Facebook to perform for me in this order.
Keep up to date with the major and minor life changes of a broad group of associates I wouldn’t otherwise keep in touch with. I think of loose friends from college, high school friends, family friends, etc.

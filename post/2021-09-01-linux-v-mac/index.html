<h1 class=title>Switching to Linux</h1>
<div class=content>
<h2 id=a-tale-of-failure>A tale of failure</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a number of blog posts where developers complain about the Apple ecosystem and show how they made the switch from MacOS to Linux. Usually, they have a complaint about the company, their anti-competitive behavior, or their intrusiveness, or their non-web focus, or their relentless un-openness. I usually find myself nodding along, and I&rsquo;m usually inspired by their post to try out some combination of alternative services or hand-rolled versions of the key Apple applications. &ldquo;I can do it!&rdquo; I say to myself, &ldquo;I can break the bond.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve tried moving to linux at least twice now, and each time I fail. Is it Messages app that keeps me tied to MacOS? Or Handoff? Is it keystrokes I just can&rsquo;t unlearn? Is it the third party apps that just don&rsquo;t have equals on other systems? It&rsquo;s all of these things, but maybe at core, it&rsquo;s an application philosophy, a way of looking at human-computer interaction that&rsquo;s just different between the two ecosystems. I&rsquo;m going to explore these differences, not with some analysis of the unix application, or of open source versus closed source, but instead, screen-shot annotation.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I know how to break away from MacOS operating system: integrate some tool or part of another operating system into your work in a way that makes it vital. For example, if I become a <code>proc</code> file master, I would have to use Linux primarily. But this strategy of &ldquo;use X instead of Y&rdquo; is never going to work for me.</p>
<h3 id=skitch>Skitch</h3>
<p><a href=https://evernote.com/products/skitch>Skitch</a> is an image annotation app from Evernote. It&rsquo;s essential look is a big magenta arrow drawn over a screenshot. It has a few other tools besides the arrow: text (which by default is also magenta, and is a bubbly thick font with a white outline so it stands out from any background), boxes, free draw, and little sticky-note like tabs. You can change the color you&rsquo;re drawing with to a series of bright 6 bright colors, black & white, and a color picker. You can also change the size of the thing you&rsquo;re drawing (arrow thickness, font size). There&rsquo;s some integration with Evernote, there&rsquo;s a screen-capture tool, highlighting, some other things, but the main drawing tools are the ones I use.</p>
<p>My workflow with the app is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+4 (MacOS screen-capture to pastable memory)</li>
<li>Move to Skitch and Cmd+v (often I have to discard the current Skitch item, I never save anything in Skitch, so this is a little work-flow interuption)</li>
<li>Make annotations</li>
<li>Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+4 again, only this time I&rsquo;m just capturing the Skitch window</li>
<li>Cmd+v where ever I&rsquo;m sending the annotated image</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s very effemeral, and I&rsquo;m fighting the app a bit by not saving anything, but it&rsquo;s a workflow I&rsquo;m extremely comfortable with, and one with which I can provide strong visual feed-back in seconds.</p>
<h3 id=the-alternative>The alternative</h3>
<p>Annotations were not the first thing I did when I switched to Linux, but it was one of the first things I realized I was missing. There are a few solutions out there, but the one that&rsquo;s the closest is <a href=https://flameshot.org/>Flameshot</a>. I have to admit, Flameshot might be a better tool in a lot of ways. It&rsquo;s interactive, not just with whatever image you&rsquo;ve pasted in, but the actual screen. And there are more built-in tools than Skitch. It&rsquo;s even configurable, so if those actions in the action list are not to your liking, you can remove them. (Also, it&rsquo;s open source and usable in Linux, Mac and Windows.)</p>
<p>However, the results don&rsquo;t look as good. The difference are tiny, but the effects are huge. In Skitch, you&rsquo;re confined to only 5 sizes for anything, but they&rsquo;re sizes that work. In Flameshot you have a slider, but it&rsquo;s to small so it&rsquo;s hard to get the right size. I was only able to get three visibly different sizes: too small, Okay, too big. In Skitch you&rsquo;re limited to one font, but it&rsquo;s a friendly font without being silly. In Flameshot, you&rsquo;ve got every font on the system, so good luck finding one that speaks in the right voice. In Skitch you have 6 default colors, but they&rsquo;re all clean and bright. In Flameshot you have a color-picker, again tyranny of choice. In Skitch there&rsquo;s dropshadows and white outline on everything. In Flameshot it&rsquo;s just flat annotations.</p>
<p>But, I hear you shouting, you&rsquo;re comparing two different apps, not operating systems! You&rsquo;re correct, but I&rsquo;m using these apps to describe a difference in philosophy between MacOS ecosystem and Linux.</p>
<p>Skitch is an app with a limited scope, and a lot of guardrails. Clearly the developers and designers focused on the look and feel, and the results the application could produce. They missed configurability, and most glaringly, they missed a part of the essence of this application: annotating screen shots. Instead, it&rsquo;s really a picture annotation app. But those design choices, the guardrails built into the app make it fast and easy to get a good-looking screenshot in very little time. This is the essential value-proposition of an app like this. I <em>could</em> open the screenshit in PhotoShop, or GIMP, but the point is to move fast and have good results. Skitch does that.</p>
<p>Flameshot is an app that know exactly what it is, a screen-shot annotation app. I really appreciate that. The problem is the output is not as good, and it&rsquo;s not as easy to use. In writing this post I figured out a bunch of things I could do with Flameshot that months of using it I&rsquo;d missed. The learning curve is steep for something that should be kind of brainless. Once it&rsquo;s configured just right, it might be better, but in the world of work, I need to move fast, not spend hours tinkering with settings.</p>
<p>I think those are pretty good metaphors for the MacOS philosophy and the Linux philosophy. Design and outcome versus functionality and configuration.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;m going to go make an issue request to add drop-shadows to Flameshot now&mldr;</p>

Switching to Linux

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
A tale of failure I&rsquo;ve seen a number of blog posts where developers complain about the Apple ecosystem and show how they made the switch from MacOS to Linux. Usually, they have a complaint about the company, their anti-competitive behavior, or their intrusiveness, or their non-web focus, or their relentless un-openness. I usually find myself nodding along, and I&rsquo;m usually inspired by their post to try out some combination of alternative services or hand-rolled versions of the key Apple applications.

Advent of Swift
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Like so many of my potential readers I’m participating in this year’s advent of code. This presents me with an opportunity to learn Swift, Apple’s app-oriented language and successor to Objective-C. There are always challenges learning a new language, and I expected those, what surprised me was how far Swift is from my daily drivers: JavaScript and PHP, and my go to “toy” language, Python. (Toy, as in, I almost never finish a Python project, not that the language is a toy).

Remove React

In the face of police violence toward Black Americans I feel mostly helpless and useless. I&rsquo;m not in the path of police violence; I&rsquo;m white, employed, and comfortable, and with two kids depending on my income, it&rsquo;s easy to remain inactive and on the sidelines. While I can state clearly, Black Lives Matter, I didn&rsquo;t have an obvious means of action.
But I want to examine a little deeper how I&rsquo;m complicit in a system of white supremacy through my engagement with the React framework.

Exploring Closures

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
I was inspired by Eric Elliot&rsquo;s post on closures. He posted on twitter with this super simple example const secret = msg => () => msg;. Here&rsquo;s the article, as usual I&rsquo;ll encourage you to read that first: https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-closure-b2f0d2152b36
The long and short is that the automatic lexical closure in javascript allows us to give us data privacy, this can be compared to protected or private properties in OOP.
Note: In the following example I&rsquo;m missing the main point!

I like my job, but it&rsquo;s not the best job. And since I deserver the best job it&rsquo;s time I found it, lucky for me Outside Magazine already did the work and found the best 100 places to work!
But Clayton, you say, that&rsquo;s a two year old post, and how come you trust some magazine to decide what is best for you? Well, I don&rsquo;t, and it is, but I&rsquo;m taking the day off and web scrapping relaxes me.

Methodical versus Systematic
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
I recently was assigned a CSS layout problem. As I was working on it I realized I hadn&rsquo;t done CSS for a while. I also noticed I was thinking in a slightly different manner then when I&rsquo;m writing PHP or JavaScript. I was thinking systematically about the problem, instead of thinking methodically.
The CSS layout system (I&rsquo;m talking here about last-generation pre-grid CSS layout) centers around the Box Model. What this means is an element is comprised of the content, padding, border and margins, in that order from inside out.

Local Overrides in Chrome

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
At the beginning of this year Chrome came out with Local Overrides features for Chrome 65. This is related, but distinct from Workspaces, which is a way to save your devtools changes to a local project. While Workspaces seems neat, it&rsquo;s rare that I&rsquo;m working on a site whose code isn&rsquo;t generated by some server-side tool. However, with Local Overrides I can work in the devtools inspector, and still persist those changes between page loads, even if they are separate from the project.

Last week on twitter Dan Abramov was highlighting some of the easy ways to get your feet wet with React. I&rsquo;ve been playing with React for a while, and had heard the idea that one could add React as an individual component, or widget, to an already existing site. This looked like a good opportunity to try it out.
Caveat before we begin, the docs are great, there&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m expanding here on what&rsquo;s already covered in the docs.

I was tasked with creating a scroll animation, something that I’ve done before, but in a very ad-hoc fashion. I think the first time I did a “parallax” style scroll I did something like this:
That worked fine on an overpowered PC and when it was moving a tiny image up and off the page, but the next task was to move an image across the page in response to scrolling, and I wanted to make sure it was performant on all devices.
